french_demoralization;French Demoralization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_demoralization_desc;The Third Republic still yet reels from the First World War, and from the continually increasing threats across nearly every border and frontier. The public and indeed many in the government themselves see the prospect of a war in continental Europe as a catastrophe France has no hope of recovering from. Survival on the line, it will take much to bring France out of this malaise and back into the realm of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_great_war;Memories of the Great War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_great_war_desc;The French Army still remembers the Great War, and has since adopted a deeply defensive doctrine meant to ensure that such a war can never happen again. This has led the army to have exceptional foresight in the development of strategic plans to contain a German offensive, but a severe lack in dynamism either amongst the rank and file or in the adoption of new doctrines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bonaparte_cult_offensive;The Bonaparte Cult of Offense;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bonaparte_cult_offensive_desc;The French Bonaparte line has reformed the army structure around itself, building what many call a cult of the offensive around themselves. While this is a source of great pride to the reorganized French military, some critics point out that this is markedly similar to the French mentality before the Great War...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bonaparte_ambition;Napoleonic Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bonaparte_ambition_desc;Characteristic to the Bonaparte line in particular is the ever-present legacy of one figure that looms large in the French psyche. Napoleon's legacy lives on in France, and the Bonaparte line is showing the characteristic signs of that same ambition that drove a man to conquer all of Europe once before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_advisors;French Advisors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_advisors_desc;The French have sent advisors and monetary aid in order to help modernize the Polish military. Whilst the French themselves are already behind in many affairs, and therefore are not of much aid in this particular regard, their officers still provide a valuable pool of experience and military expertise so as to generally improve the structure of the military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
